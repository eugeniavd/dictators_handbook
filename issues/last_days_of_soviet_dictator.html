                    <h2>Stalin had poor health and did not trust doctors</h2>
                    <p>The state of health of Kremlin leaders is still one of the most important state secrets. During

                        time, this secret was guarded especially strictly, and propaganda spread the myth of a "strong
                        Caucasian body". So the researchers had to collect real facts piecemeal — in fragments of
                        documents, letters, and memories.</p>

                        in the muscles of his arms and legs. On the recommendation of doctors,

                        developed new problems — signs of hypertension and atherosclerosis. By the end of the Second
                        World War, the problems intensified. At the
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">end of 1945</span>, he had his first heart attack, and in
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">1946</span>,

                        suffered a severe stroke. During these periods, even his daughter

                        was forbidden not only to visit her father, but also to call him.</p>
                    <p>Despite this,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        did not lead a healthy lifestyle. He smoked a lot, regularly drank alcohol, especially before
                        going to bed. And he went to bed late after 15-18 hours of sedentary working day. His "diet"
                        consisted of fatty Caucasian dishes.</p>
                    <p>He followed the doctorsʼ advice selectively. After a stroke in
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">1946</span>, he spent more time at his suburban dacha in
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plKu">Kuntsevo</span>.</p>
                    <p>Now

                        walked a lot in the park in the fresh air, but continued to smoke and drink alcohol. Also, he
                        slept too little. When his health took a turn for the worse, he abruptly quit smoking on the eve
                        of his 72nd birthday in
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">December 1952</span>. Of course, it was not easy for the smoker with
                        more than 50 years of experience. He gained weight, became irritable and agitated, and had
                        problems with blood pressure.</p>

                    <p>In addition, telling the chief about his illnesses was dangerous for the health of the doctors
                        themselves. In
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">1927</span>, rumors spread in Moscow medical circles about the
                        sudden death of the well-known neuropathologist and psychiatrist
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="VlBe">Vladimir Bekhterev</span>. According to legend, he

                        told his acquaintances about his discovery. And in a few days, he died right during a congress
                        of neuropathologists and psychiatrists. According to the official version, the doctor "poisoned
                        with canned goods" at the banquet. No forensic investigation into the circumstances of death was
                        conducted, and the body was quickly cremated.</p>

                        the chiefʼs bedroom. Finally, around six in the evening, the light came on in his room, so the
                        security relaxed a bit. A reason to go to the chiefʼs room was found only around ten in the

                    <h2>Versions about the murder</h2>
                    <p>There are many conspiracy theories about
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="StDe">Stalinʼs death</span>, as if the dictator was
                        killed. But none of them can be confirmed due to the lack of documents and closed access to the
                        archives of the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="KGB">Kremlin special services</span>.</p>
                    <p>Most historians and researchers agree that when it comes to
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalinʼs</span>&#32;
                        murder, the culprits should be sought in his closest circle. First of all, this concerns
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="GeMa">Malenkov</span>,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>&#32;
                        and

                        never had real power and strength. He was an old party member who from time to time "plugged"
                        holes in various ministries and departments.</p>

                        can be accused of not providing timely assistance to
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>. With such a diagnosis, even in
                        modern medicine, the patientʼs chances of survival are 50/50, and this is under the conditions
                        of operative medical care. And doctors were allowed to see
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        almost half a day later. However, it is unlikely that these three would be able to organize a
                        conspiracy, even a spontaneous one. Actually,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        was the person who kept them from starting to fight among themselves for power.</p>

                        can be explained by fear. During the rule of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>, no one was immune from unexpected
                        repressions, especially his closest circle. And the dictator himself liked to remind them about
                        this from time to time. So given his suspiciousness, the trio could have gotten into trouble
                        even if they had called the doctors right away. The leader could suspect that they want to
                        declare him incompetent and remove him from power.</p>
                    <p>In the
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">2000s</span>, a new theory appeared that
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        was allegedly poisoned with warfarin. This drug thins the blood, preventing it from clotting.
                        But in case of an overdose, it can cause severe bleeding. However, modern medical research
                        refutes this theory, based on data on the autopsy of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalinʼs</span>&#32;
                        body. And it is unlikely that anyone would be able to bring something suspicious to
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalinʼs</span>&#32;
                        dacha. Even his closest four comrades were thoroughly searched by the guards twice — at the gate
                        and at the entrance to the house. And this especially annoyed the old Chekist

                    <p>Historians cite some facts to support this theory. It was

                        who selected the doctors who tried to save

                        and allegedly told them what to write in the medical documents. They recall the story of

                        autopsy. Apparently, he detected signs of poisoning of the leader. But already on
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">April 12, 1953</span>, he "died prematurely." The day after

                        — according to the official version, they shot themselves. Also, by order of
