                        as he did after. When asked by a popular biographer who was plowing the same ground what I was
                        focusing on, I answered that my interest was in the revolutionary movement, Social Democracy,
                        labor, and Marxist thought and politics. “Oh good,” he said with relief, “I am interested in his
                        women.”</p>
                    <p>I set out to place

                        within the competing cultures through which the son of an alcoholic shoemaker became a major
                        revolutionary and the architect of what he proclaimed to be the first “socialist” society in
                        history. Toward the end of his life, he was arguably the most powerful individual in the world.
                        Yet at various earlier times, he had been seen as a “gray blur,” “the man who missed the
                        revolution,” a “mediocrity” hooked by history. He was

                        “marvelous Georgian,” in wartime the “Generalissimo,” and still later “History’s villain.”</p>
                    <p>Eschewing the methods of psychohistory, I nevertheless needed to probe into a man, his mind, and
                        experience, all of which were singularly opaque.

                        is without doubt one of the most tempting and, at the same time, least hospitable subjects for a
                        biographer. Not particularly introspective, he left few intimate letters, no secret diary, and
                        many dubious witnesses to his inner life.</p>
                    <p>Moreover,

                        political culture was hostile to open personal expression and imposed on

                        and its other adherents an enforced modesty. Denial of the importance of self was part of the
                        Social Democratic tradition. Even as a grotesque cult of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>&#32;
                        personality grew to gargantuan proportions,

                        would continue, disingenuously, to claim that he disliked all the fuss.</p>

                        created distinct mystifying narratives about who he was. In the

                        life story has always been more than biography. There is wonder at the achievement — the son of
                        a Georgian cobbler ascending the heights of world power; the architect of an
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="InSU">industrial revolution</span>&#32;
                        and the destruction of millions of the people he ruled; the leader of the state that stopped the
                        bloody expansion of fascism.
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>&#32;
                        story is that of the making of the
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="USSR">Soviet Union</span>&#32;
                        and a particular vision of what he called socialism. His biographers have often placed
                        historical imagination at the service of a specific politics of eroding (or lauding) the
                        Stalinist inheritance.</p>
                    <p>Such a life story cannot be separated from an evaluation of that life’s work. In
                        twenty-first-century
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plRu">Russia</span>, visions of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        are deployed to justify yet another slide into authoritarianism, while in the West, the entirety
                        of the Soviet experience is often reduced to
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        and Stalinism, the

                        achievements and tragedies, are so morally and emotionally charged that they challenge the usual
                        practices of historical objectivity and scholarly neutrality. When it comes to
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>, gossip is reported as fact; legend
                        provides meaning.</p>

                        — are the most elusive and obscure period of his life. Here the lasting fascination with the
                        demon dictator is matched by an irresistible temptation to make his childhood and youth
                        “useful,” by investing them with the first signs of the paranoid revolutionary-from-above of the
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">1930s</span>, the arch-criminal who presided over the death of

                        paranoia, arrogance, and the need to dominate — and rejecting what does not — romanticism,
                        literary sensibility, love for his homeland, and revolutionary idealism. As important as

                        early life was to the formation of his personality, the difficulties of reconstructing it from
                        the few extant memoirs about his youth and scanty available documentation have sometimes led to
                        flimsily-built psychoanalytic speculation, and, at other times, to fanciful arguments that

                        case, the psychohistorians have proposed parental abuse — impoverishes explanation. Most
                        historians have been suspicious of a method that leaves so much out — culture and context,
                        politics and ideas — and renders stated motivations suspect, reducing them to psychological
                        functions (rationalization, compensation, sublimation).</p>

                        opponent, composed the first memoir of the Soviet ruler’s childhood, where he made the primary
                        psychological deduction later followed by other biographers:</p>
                    <p>Undeserved, terrible beatings made the boy as hard and heartless as his father himself. Since all
                        men who had authority over others either through power or age reminded him of his father, there
                        soon arose a feeling of revenge against all men who stood above him. From his youth the
                        realization of his thoughts of revenge became the goal toward which everything was aimed.</p>

                        evidently had a different evaluation of the disciplining practiced by his parents. When the
                        popular German biographer
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="EmLu">Emil Ludwig</span>, known for his interviews with
                        the political celebrities of the interwar years, met with

                        of parental abuse: “What pushed you into opposition? Perhaps the bad treatment by your parents?”
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        did not take the bait, however. “No,” he answered. “My parents were uneducated people, but they
                        treated me not badly at all.”</p>

                        revealed himself through what he did and said in public. Ten years after I began my research,
                        the Soviet archives were opened, and more reliable testimonies came forth. Biographers were able
                        for the first time to place the man in his private world, show his limits as well as his
                        talents, and work toward a portrait that might explain the seemingly inexplicable.</p>

                        was an exceptional individual because of what he became and what he did, the positions he
                        occupied in a tumultuous time. But like many people in higher politics, he was at the same time
                        quite ordinary — a small man placed in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

                        psychological evolution is treated as the interplay between the developing character of the boy

                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>, the revolutionary intelligentsia,
                        the Marxist movement, the underground, prison and exile, on to the upper circles of Russian

                        political system, and the political cultures of socialism — left its imprint upon
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>, changing him along the way.</p>
                    <p>As life’s experiences molded him, what he was becoming modified what he had been. He was not born
                        a criminal and did not become a Caucasian bandit. Rather than being a gangster out to enrich
                        himself, he was the product of — and a participant in — an evolving culture of the underground
                        revolutionary. Idealism and ideology, as well as resentment and ambition, impelled him to endure
                        the risks and recklessness of a political outlaw.</p>
                    <p>He hardened himself, accepted the necessity of deception, ruthlessness, and violence — all these
                        means justified by the end of social and political liberation. Before the story of a “revolution
                        betrayed” can be told, the story must first be recounted of how a political revolutionary was
                        made, along with the emergence of the revolutionary movement, its possibilities, ambitions, and
                        trials.</p>

                        was the first cultural environment that he experienced. Yet it is hard to claim that

                    <p>His boyhood country was a lively arena in which people defined and defended what they considered
                        to be their culture and its values, often bitterly disagreeing with other members of the same
                        ethnicity. Nationalists like to think of ethnic culture as something harmonious and consistent,
                        with those inside that culture sharing characteristics that differ radically from those outside.

                    <p>Among Georgians, values and behaviors were simultaneously shared and contested. Older traditions
                        contended with novel divisions of power and shifts in status and gender hierarchies. Poets and
                        politicians made claims about what was authentically “Georgian.” In the half century before
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>&#32;
                        birth, there were those ready to “police” the boundaries of Georgian culture, tell others what
                        was authentic and proper, and discipline deviants.</p>
                    <p>Aspects of

                        ethnic culture were breaking down and being reformulated, and intellectuals turned their
                        attention to what they feared was about to be lost. But young
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso Jughashvili</span>, influenced by his doting
                        mother, identified intensely with
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>, its practices and preferences, the
                        beautiful intricacies and cadences of its language, its music, and its hypermasculine gender

                    <p>A more mature
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Koba</span>&#32;
                        eventually broke through what he found to be the confining limits of nationality to identify
                        with an explicitly anti-nationalist political party and its socialist future. In rapid
                        succession,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso</span>&#32;
                        left the largely Georgian town of his birth and entered other cultural milieus: the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="OrCs">Orthodox Christian seminary</span>, the
                        intelligentsia, the movement, and the party.</p>
                    <p>By his twenty-first birthday, he had become a professional revolutionary defined by a new
                        culture: the political culture of Russian Social Democracy, with its specific forms of moral and
                        personal behavior, its idealized self-representations of what constituted an intelligent (a
                        radical political intellectual), and its elaborate codes of loyalty and sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>During the
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="CldW">Cold War</span>, battalions of Soviet and Western
                        scholars explored the history of Russian Social Democracy, the Marxist movement that had split
                        irrevocably into
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="Blsh">Bolshevik</span>&#32;
                        and

                        tendencies by
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">1905</span>, and whose radical wing led by
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="VlLe">Vladimir Lenin</span>&#32;
                        came to power in
                        &#32;<span data-type="date">October 1917</span>. The stories they told were diametrically
                        opposed to one another, each a product of the intellectual and political imperatives of their
                        respective worlds.</p>
                    <p>With the fall of the
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="USSR">Soviet Union</span>, interest in the intricacies of
                        the political struggles of the Marxist factions, and their meanings and influences on the Soviet
                        future evaporated. Yet at the same moment, the less contentious environment of the post-Soviet
                        period, along with the opening of Soviet archives, made possible a reevaluation of the history
                        of Russian (and Georgian) Marxism, and their respective and distinct labor movements.</p>
                    <p>Since those movements and the Marxist underground were the major breeding grounds for

                        and those around him, I have undertaken in Stalin: Passage to Revolution a fresh reading of the
                        history of those movements out of which the Soviet experiment and
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        himself emerged.</p>

                    <h2>The Logic of War</h2>
                    <p>Elaborating the cultural worlds through which the young
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        passed makes possible a fuller understanding of the sources of the Soviet leader’s particular
                        psychology, and the determinants of his personal and political trajectory. An understanding of
                        the man comes from setting him in his time and place, even though some parts of his inner
                        workings undoubtedly remain elusive, buried in regions to which historians are not admitted.</p>
                    <p>Poverty was the condition of the world into which he came. The constant and demanding attention
                        and fierce adulation focused on her son by
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso’s</span>&#32;
                        single present parent, his mother, fed his social resentment at his place in the scheme of
                        things. Aware of being marginalized and at the same time talented,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso</span>&#32;
                        found that hard work and discipline moved him to the front of the class. His inheritance from
                        both parents was ambition.</p>
                    <p>The usual biographical narrative, with its organic continuity between boy, young adult, and
                        mature man, is challenged by the reconstruction of the available fragments of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>&#32;
                        life. Those fragments suggest a much more disjointed evolution, in the course of which
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso/Koba/Stalin</span>&#32;
                        shed one identity and took on another. The obedient child and priest-in-training became a rebel;
                        the Georgian patriot and romantic poet became an assimilated Russian — though only in part, and
                        primarily in his public posture. The militant
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="Blsh">Bolshevik</span>&#32;
                        at times took on the coloring of a moderate.</p>
                    <p>As he moved physically and psychologically away from
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        left behind a culture in which one’s sense of personhood derived from family, friends, and
                        nation, and entered a world in which one defined one’s own nature in line with a particular
                        understanding of historical direction and the unforgiving imperatives of politics. By becoming a
                        rebel against the existing order, revolutionaries like
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        declared
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="CldW">war</span>&#32;
                        on constituted authorities.</p>
                    <p>For Marxists in the
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plRu">Russian Empire</span>, politics were less about
                        compromise and persuasion, and more about the violent, unforgiving confrontations to be found on
                        the battlefield. A logic of war prevailed, one that required (sometimes with regret) the use of
                        violence.
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        responded both to inner needs and external possibilities and challenges, and was deeply changed
                        by the experiences of
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="OrCs">seminary</span>, underground, prison,
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="InSU">revolution</span>,
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="RuCW">civil war</span>, and political power. The figure
                        that emerged on the world stage was simultaneously a product of the successive cultures through
                        which he passed, and an actor making choices and defining himself in unprecedented and
                        unpredictable historical circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Delving deep into
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>&#32;
                        and its culture, I attempted carefully to construct a mosaic of diverse pieces of information —
                        from the variety of archival documents, official and unofficial memoirs, even photographs —
                        until a legible portrait of young
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        emerged. My aim was to evoke from that mosaic a credible and convincing interpretation of the
                        evolution of the boy,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso Jughashvili</span>, through the young
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Koba</span>, to the mature
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        — an elucidation of his personal, psychological, and political formation that could shed light
                        on his motivations and choices.</p>
                    <p><span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Jughashvili</span>&#32;
                        remains an elusive character, even to the most diligent scholar, but his early life provides
                        important clues to the mysteries of
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>&#32;
                        and, hopefully, offers some understanding of why a
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="InSU">revolution</span>&#32;
                        committed to human emancipation ended up in dictatorship and terror.</p>
