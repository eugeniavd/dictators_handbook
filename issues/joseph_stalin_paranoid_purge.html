                    <p>The first hint of the slaughter to come emerged at a conference of the

                        was reaching its heights of terror. The craven, incompetent commissar for war, Marshal
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Kliment Voroshilov</span>, told those assembled:
                        “Happily, we have not as yet discovered many enemies in the army. I can say happily in the hope
                        that there are not very many enemies in the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="RdAr">Red Army</span>.” But

                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>. “If we have wreckers in every
                        branch of the economy, can we imagine that in one place alone, the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="WaDe">War Department</span>, there are none?” said
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="VyMo">Molotov</span>&#32;
                        ominously. “It would be absurd to do so. The
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="WaDe">War Department</span>&#32;
                        is a very large affair, and its work will be checked not now but a little later. And it will be
                        examined very rigorously.”</p>

                    <h2>The Scale of Stalin’s Slaughter</h2>
                    <p>The

                        remaining marshal,
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="VsBl">Vasilli Blyukher</span>, was beaten to death after
                        refusing to confess; his widow said he looked like a tank had run over him. In two years’ time,
                        36,671
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="RdAr">Red Army</span>&#32;
                        officers were executed, shipped to the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="Gulg">gulag</span>, or dismissed from service.
                        Those who were killed were probably luckier than those who were imprisoned. One general who
                        survived internment recalled seeing other officers in his camp “on all fours, howling and
                        rooting about, they had become semi-idiots whom no amount of beating could drive from the refuse
                        heaps.”</p>
                    <p>The scale of the
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>&#32;
                        was staggering: 13 of 15 army commanders, 50 of 57 corps commanders, 154 of 186 divisional
                        commanders, 220 of 406 brigade commanders, all 11 vice-commanders of defense, 98 of 108 members
                        of the Supreme Military Soviets, all army political commissars, 25 of 28 corps commissars, 58 of
                        64 divisional commissars. Even the lower ranks were not spared: almost half the colonels and
                        7,403 captains fell victim to the
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>. “This is worse than when artillery
                        fires on its own troops,” commented General

                        and colonels were killed by

                        produced appropriately macabre scenes. An officer back from secret service in
                        &#32;<span data-type="event" data-id="SpCW">Spain’s civil war</span>&#32;
                        phoned friend after friend at their homes, only to find strangers now answering their phones. A
                        general dropped dead of a heart attack upon hearing the dreaded predawn knock on his door—it
                        turned out to have been a harmless messenger.</p>
                    <p>“With each arrest it became more difficult to believe in the disloyalty, the sabotage, the
                        treachery of these men,” said General
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="AlGo">Alexander Gorbatov</span>. When he protested the
                        arrest of his superior, he was inevitably jailed himself. Other officers he met in jail advised
                        him to confess to anything about anyone “because they believed it was better to stand on their
                        false testimony in order to put an end as quickly as possible to the torment and to die as
                        quickly as possible.” But

                        was an exception and, surprisingly, was not shot for his defiance, but merely sent to a Siberian
                        labor camp.</p>
                    <p>Another defiant general was
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="KoRo">Konstantin Rokossovsky</span>. After having eight
                        teeth knocked out and three ribs broken, he was hauled before the
                        &#32;<span data-type="organization" data-id="SuCo">Supreme Military Court</span>&#32;
                        and told that another officer, named
                        &#32;<span data-type="person" data-id="AdYu">Yushkevich</span>, had confessed to spying with him
                        for
                        &#32;<span data-type="place" data-id="plGr">Germany</span>. Instead of submissively agreeing

                        shouted back, “Can the dead give evidence?” “What do you mean the dead?” the surprised judge
                        asked.

                        replied, “Well,

                <p>The purpose of this web site is to explore various types of typographic and layout style for text
                    documents, as an end-of-course project for the "Information Modeling and Web technologies" course of
                    the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, under
                    prof. Fabio Vitali. The documents contained in this web site have been selected for their length and
                    complexity from their respective source publications. Their publication here is not intended to be
                    an alternative or replace their original locations:</p>
