                    time, this secret was guarded especially strictly, and propaganda spread the myth of a
                    "strong Caucasian body". So the researchers had to collect real facts piecemeal — in
                    fragments of documents, letters, and memories.

                    did not leave his room at noon, as was usually the case. Motion detectors installed in each room did not detect any
                    movements. So the guards began to worry, but they did not dare to look into the chiefʼs bedroom. Finally, around six in the evening,
                    the light came on in his room, so the security relaxed a bit. A reason to go to the chiefʼs room was found only around ten in the
                    evening — business mail was brought, and it had to be handed over personally.

                    With such a diagnosis, even in modern medicine, the patientʼs chances of survival are 50/50, and this is under the
                    conditions of operative medical care. And doctors were allowed to see

                    no one was immune from unexpected repressions, especially his closest circle. And the dictator himself liked to remind them about this from time to time.
