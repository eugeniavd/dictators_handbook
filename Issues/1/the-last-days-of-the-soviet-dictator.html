                      course, about versions of a possible murder.
                </p>

                <h3>Stalin had poor health and did not trust doctors</h3>
                <p>The state of health of Kremlin leaders is still one of the most important state secrets. During Stalin's time, this secret was guarded especially strictly, and propaganda spread the myth of a "strong Caucasian body." So the researchers had to collect real facts piecemeal — in fragments of documents, letters, and memories.</p>

                <p>Stalin's first serious health problems began around <span class="tag date">1926</span>, when he was 48 years old. He complained of severe pain in the muscles of his arms and legs. On the recommendation of doctors, Stalin underwent a course of hydrogen sulfide baths in <span class="tag place">Abkhazia</span>.</p>

                <p>By <span class="tag date">1946</span>, Stalin suffered a severe stroke. During these periods, even his daughter <span class="tag person">Svetlana</span> was forbidden not only to visit her father but also to call him.</p>

                <p>He spent more time at his suburban dacha in <span class="tag place">Kuntsevo</span>.</p>

                <div class="info-reference">

                <p>In <span class="tag date">1927</span>, rumors spread in <span class="tag place">Moscow</span> medical circles about the sudden death of the well-known neuropathologist and psychiatrist <span class="tag person">Vladimir Bekhterev</span>. According to legend, he was called to examine Stalin, and he unexpectedly diagnosed the Soviet dictator with a severe form of paranoia.</p>

                <p><span class="tag person">Vladimir Vinogradov</span> was Stalin's personal physician from the mid-1940s. In <span class="tag date">1952</span>, he strongly advised the dictator to work less and rest more. Stalin suspected a conspiracy, thinking that his enemies allegedly tried to remove him from the leadership of the state in this way. In <span class="tag date">November 1952</span>, Vinogradov ended up in prison as part of the <span class="tag event">Doctors' Affair</span>.</p>

                <p>In the story of Stalin's death, <span class="tag person">Lavrentiy Beria</span> deserves the most suspicion. According to researchers, he had a strong motive to get rid of the leader. After all, it was Beria who was to become the main figure in the <span class="tag event">Megreli case</span>.</p>

                    The campaign against high-ranking officials and prosecutors of the Georgian SSR, who were from Megrelia, a historical region in western Georgia. They were accused of a "nationalist conspiracy" with the aim of separating Georgia from the USSR. The first arrests began in November 1951. And in April 1953, a high-profile public trial was to take place, at which the accused were supposed to name Beria as the main organizer.
