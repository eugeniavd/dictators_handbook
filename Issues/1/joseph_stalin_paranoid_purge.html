            Officer corps expect to suffer heavy losses in war. The entire <span class="tag date">1914</span> class of France’s <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_sp%C3%A9ciale_militaire_de_Saint-Cyr">St. Cyr military academy</span>, 
            for example, perished in <span class="tag event">World War I</span>. But no officer corps ever suffered the degree of loss that the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span> suffered 
            in peacetime, at the hands of its own government, during dictator <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Joseph Stalin’</span>s paranoid <span class="tag event">purge</span> of <span class="tag date">1937</span>-<span class="tag date">1938</span>.
          </p>
        <h3>Paranoia in the Communist Party</h3>
          <p>
            The first hint of the slaughter to come emerged at a conference of the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">Communist Party</span> in <span class="tag date">March 1937</span>, just as <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> 
            <span class="tag event">Great Purge</span> was reaching its heights of terror. The craven, incompetent commissar for war, Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Kliment Voroshilov</span>, 
            told those assembled: “Happily, we have not as yet discovered many enemies in the army. I can say happily in the hope 
            that there are not very many enemies in the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span>.” But <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> ranking lackey, Premier <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</span>, 
            immediately contradicted <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span>. “If we have wreckers in every branch of the economy, can we imagine that in one 
            place alone, the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Soviet_Union)">War Department</span>, there are none?” said <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov">Molotov</span> ominously. “It would be absurd to do so. The <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Soviet_Union)">War Department</span> 
            is a very large affair, and its work will be checked not now but a little later. And it will be examined very rigorously.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In a climate where stamp collectors could be shot for valuing old foreign stamps over new Soviet ones featuring 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> portrait and astronomers could be executed for taking an ideologically incorrect position on sunspots, 
            not even the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span> was above suspicion. To begin with, it had been founded, organized, and largely officered by 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> despised, defeated rival <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</span>, and it remained under tenuous party control. Most suspicious of all 
            was its long association with the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army_(1935%E2%80%931945)">German Army</span>, going back to secret training in the <span class="tag date">1920s</span> and ongoing visits by Red 
            Army officers to <span class="tag place">Nazi Germany</span>.
          </p>
        <h3>A Blood-Splattered Confession</h3>
          <p>
            Much of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s </span> paranoid fixation about the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span> was focused on its head, Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Mikhail Tukhachevsky</span>. As brutal 
            as <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> in quelling opposition, using poison gas on revolting peasants, and executing reform-seeking sailors, 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> was a brilliant advocate of armored warfare. But it was his very emphasis on military professionalism 
            that struck at the principle of party loyalty—which meant, essentially, loyalty to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>. Added to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky’s</span> 
            problems was the personal animosity of Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny">Semyon Budenny</span>, one of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> closest military cronies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rigorous examination of the army that <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov">Molotov</span> had threatened actually had started seven months earlier with the 
            arrest of a divisional commander in <span class="tag place">Kiev</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Shmidt">Dmitri Shmidt</span>. A supporter of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Trotsky</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Shmidt">Shmidt</span> once had threatened to lop off 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> ears with his sword. In what would become standard treatment at the hands of the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD">NKVD</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Shmidt">Shmidt</span> confessed to 
            plotting to assassinate <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span>, then received what became the standard consequence for such apostasy—a bullet to 
            the back of the head. A corps commander close to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevky</span> was arrested next, confessed in turn to plotting with 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Trotsky</span>, and was shot as well.

            In <span class="tag place">Nazi Germany</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</span> and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</span> forged documents showing <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> and other generals were 
            plotting with them against <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, and had them passed to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> through the <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Bene%C5%A1">president of Czechoslovakia</span>. (Although 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler">Himmler</span> and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich">Heydrich</span> would take credit for the bloodbath that followed, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> had already determined his murderous 
            course of action and apparently made no use of the forgeries.) <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> struck without warning. On <span class="tag date">May Day</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> 
            found his way to his usual parade spot atop <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin’s</span> Tomb blocked by security guards, and 10 days later, without 
            explanation, he was demoted to the command of the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Military_District">Volga Military District</span>. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> assured <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> that he would 
            soon be back in <span class="tag place">Moscow</span>, and he was—arrested on arrival and thrown into the dreaded <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_Building">Lubyanka Prison</span> with Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Ion Yakir</span> and six other generals.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took just two days for <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> to sign a confession to being a Nazi spy. When his interrogation record was 
            uncovered decades later after the fall of communism, the pages were splattered with blood—chilling evidence of the 
            kind of force used to break the physically imposing <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span>. One of the generals, resigned to his fate, simply 
            signed anything put before him to enjoy a comfortable cell, tea, and cigarettes for his last few days.
          </p>
        <h3>“Puppets in the Hands of the German Army”</h3>
          <p>
            At an emergency meeting of <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span> generals to explain the arrests, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> charged: “These men are puppets in the 
            hand of the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army_(1935%E2%80%931945)">German Army</span>. The <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army_(1935%E2%80%931945)">German Army</span> wants the government here to be overthrown and they undertook to accomplish 
            that but didn’t succeed. The <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army_(1935%E2%80%931945)">German Army</span> wanted the army to be disrupted so that it would not be ready to defend 
            the country.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span> now changed his tune from three months before, saying: “I am greatly to blame. I did not detect these base 
            traitors.” But he was quick to spread the blame. “I cannot point to a single warning signal from you,” he said, 
            adding, “I never trusted <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span>.” He went on to warn the generals: “We have not purged everyone yet. I personally 
            don’t doubt that there are people who thought they were only talking, that’s all. They chattered: ‘It would be a good 
            thing to kill <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span>.’ Our government will extinguish such people.”
          </p>
          <p>
            From his cell, Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Yakir</span> wrote <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> a pitiful plea for mercy. “My entire conscious life has been spent working 
            selflessly and honestly in full view of the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">Party</span> and its leaders,” he professed. “Every word I say is honest, and 
            I shall die with words of love for you, the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">Party</span>, and the country with boundless faith in the victory of Communism.” 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> wrote on the appeal: “Swine and prostitute.” Vorsohilov chimed in: “A perfectly precise definition.” <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> 
            political toadies followed suit. “Entire agreement with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>,” penned <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov">Molotov</span>; <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_Kaganovich">Lazar Kaganovich</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Yakir’s</span> erstwhile 
            best friend, went furthest of all. “For a bastard, scum, and whore, there is only one punishment,” he said, 
            “the death penalty.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That outcome was foreordained when <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Yakir</span>, and the others went into court for a secret trial on <span class="tag date">June 11, 1937</span>. 
            “When I saw those scoundrels in the courtroom, I was shivering. A beast was in me. I didn’t want to judge them, but beat 
            and beat them in a wild frenzy,” said one of the judges, General <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Belov_(commander)">Ivan Belov</span>. “I feel I’m dreaming,” said <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span>. 
            The 18-hour marathon proceeding consisted solely of reading the defendants’ “confessions” and listening to abuse from 
            the judges. All the defendants were sentenced to death and shot, one by one, within an hour by the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_Building">Lubyanka’s</span> feared 
            senior executioner, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Blokhin">Vasili Blokhin</span>. (A few years later, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Blokhin">Blokhin</span> would organize and help to carry out the infamous <span class="tag event" id="katyn">Katyn massacre</span> 
             of Polish officers.)
          </p>
          <p>
            “The snake said he was dedicated to the Motherland and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Comrade Stalin</span>,” <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD">NKVD</span> chief <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Yezhov">Nikoli Yezhov</span> reported about 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky’s</span> last words. He was fortunate not to live to see what such devotion was worth. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> had the general’s 
            wife and two brothers shot, and his mother, daughter, and sisters shipped to a <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">gulag</span>. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Yakir’s</span> last words were also 
            to no avail. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> had his wife, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the judges, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Belov_(commander)">General Belov</span>, told writer <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Ehrenburg">Ilya Ehrenburg</span>: “Tomorrow I shall be put in the same place.” He was 
            right: within the next 18 months, he and five other of the eight judges were executed. There was almost another. 
            The <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD">NKVD</span> came for <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny">Budenny</span>, but he held them off at pistol point while calling <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> to get the order canceled. 
            The police left with his wife, instead.
          </p>
        <h3>The Scale of Stalin’s Slaughter</h3>
          <p>
            The <span class="tag place">Soviet Union’s</span> remaining marshal, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Blyukher">Vasilli Blyukher</span>, was beaten to death after refusing to confess; his widow said 
            he looked like a tank had run over him. In two years’ time, 36,671 <<span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Red Army</span> officers were executed, shipped to the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">gulag</span>, 
            or dismissed from service. Those who were killed were probably luckier than those who were imprisoned. One general who 
            survived internment recalled seeing other officers in his camp “on all fours, howling and rooting about, they had become 
            semi-idiots whom no amount of beating could drive from the refuse heaps.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The scale of the <span class="tag event">purge</span> was staggering: 13 of 15 army commanders, 50 of 57 corps commanders, 154 of 186 divisional commanders, 
            220 of 406 brigade commanders, all 11 vice-commanders of defense, 98 of 108 members of the Supreme Military Soviets, 
            all army political commissars, 25 of 28 corps commissars, 58 of 64 divisional commissars. Even the lower ranks were not spared:
            almost half the colonels and 7,403 captains fell victim to the <span class="tag event">purge</span>. “This is worse than when artillery fires on its own troops,”
            commented General <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</span>. More Soviet generals and colonels were killed by <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> than were to fall in <span class="tag event">World War II</span>.

          <p>
            The <span class="tag event">purge</span> produced appropriately macabre scenes. An officer back from secret service in <span class="tag event">Spain’s civil war</span>  phoned friend 
            after friend at their homes, only to find strangers now answering their phones. A general dropped dead of a heart attack 
            upon hearing the dreaded predawn knock on his door—it turned out to have been a harmless messenger.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With each arrest it became more difficult to believe in the disloyalty, the sabotage, the treachery of these men,” 
            said General <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gorbatov">Alexander Gorbatov</span>. When he protested the arrest of his superior, he was inevitably jailed himself. Other 
            officers he met in jail advised him to confess to anything about anyone “because they believed it was better to stand 
            on their false testimony in order to put an end as quickly as possible to the torment and to die as quickly as possible.” 
            But <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gorbatov">Gorbatov</span> was an exception and, surprisingly, was not shot for his defiance, but merely sent to a Siberian labor camp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another defiant general was <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</span>. After having eight teeth knocked out and three ribs broken, he was 
            hauled before the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Soviet_Union">Supreme Military Court</span> and told that another officer, named <span class="tag person">Yushkevich</span>, had confessed to spying with 
            him for <span class="tag place">Germany</span>. Instead of submissively agreeing with the accusation and taking a bullet, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> shouted back, 
            “Can the dead give evidence?” “What do you mean the dead?” the surprised judge asked. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> replied, “Well, <span class="tag person">Adolf 
            Kazimirovich Yushkevich</span> was killed in <span class="tag date">1920</span> at <span class="tag place">Perekop</span>.” When records bore him out, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> became perhaps the only 
            defendant ever acquitted in the <span class="tag event">purge</span>, although he was still sent to one of the most dreaded <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">gulag</span> camps in <span class="tag place">Siberia</span>, <span class="tag place">Vorkuta</span>.
          </p>
        <h3>The Outcome of the Purge</h3>
          <p>
            The effects of the <span class="tag event">purge</span> could be seen in the disastrous winter <span class="tag event">war with Finland</span> in <span class="tag date">1939</span>-<span class="tag date">1940</span>. As described by future 
            Soviet premier <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</span>: “<span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> was furious with the military and with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span>—justifiably in my opinion. 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> jumped up in a rage and started to berate <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span>. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span> was also boiling mad. He leaped up, turned red, 
            and hurled <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> accusations back in his face: ‘You have yourself to blame for all this! You’re the one who had our 
            best generals killed!’ <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span> then picked up a platter of roast suckling pig and hurled it against the table.” 
            Although dismissed as commissar for defense, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span> amazingly was not shot for his actions. He survived <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> to 
            serve as the <span class="tag place">Soviet Union’s</span> ceremonial president, living until <span class="tag date">1970</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the Finnish fiasco, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> rehabilitated and restored 13,000 officers. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> was sent to a seaside resort 
            to recuperate and equipped with twin rows of metal teeth. Always one to enjoy toying with his victims, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> faked 
            surprise upon seeing <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span>. “I don’t seem to have seen you around for some time,” said the dictator. “Where did 
            you go?” “I was arrested, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Comrade Stalin</span>,” <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> responded. “I was sitting in prison.” <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> laughed. “A fine time 
            you chose to go to prison!”
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> went on to be the greatest Soviet commander of <span class="tag event">World War II</span> after <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov">Grigori Zhukov</span>, helping to win the  
            <span class="tag event">battles of Stalingrad</span> and <span class="tag place">Kursk</span> and conquering <span class="tag place">Berlin</span>. Another hero of the war to come, Marshal <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Konev">Ivan Konev</span>, would argue: “Of the 
            commanders destroyed—<span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Yegorov_(soldier)">Yeogorov</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Yakir">Yakir</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kork">Kork</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ieronim_Uborevich">Uborevich</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Blyukher">Blyuker</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Dybenko">Dybenko</span>—only <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</span> and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ieronim_Uborevich">Uborevich</span> can 
            be regarded as modern military leaders. Most of them were on the level with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov">Voroshilov</span> and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny">Budenny</span>. Those heroes of the 
            <span class="tag event">Civil War</span> were living on their past. If they had remained at the top the war would have turned out quite differently.” 
            <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Konev">Konev</span> might have thought differently had he known that when he was defeated early in the war, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> wanted him shot but 
            was talked out of it by <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Zhukov">Zhukov</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until his death in <span class="tag date">1968</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky">Rokossovsky</span> never spoke of his ordeal in the <span class="tag event">purge</span>. Once, however, while a marshal of the Soviet 
            Union, he was crossing Siberian airspace and had his plane fly over the site of his old camp. As he looked down, the 
            former prisoner muttered a brief epitaph for his fellow victims: “No traces left.”
