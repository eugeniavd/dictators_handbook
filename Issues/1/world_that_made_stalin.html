                Some aspects of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> life will always remain a mystery. But a fresh look
                 at the Soviet dictator’s formative years can help us understand the rise and fall of the system he built.

        <p>It is the unhappy fate of a historian of the <span class="tag place">Soviet Union</span> to have to deal with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, and the fraught question of how the popular 
            <span class="tag event">revolution</span> that took place a dozen years before he achieved supreme power mutated from a vast movement for social and political 
            emancipation into a murderous despotism. The Left has been saddled, hobbled, crippled by the legacy of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and Stalinism. Liberals 
            and conservatives constantly resurrect the dark years of his rule as proof of the true meaning and nature of socialism.
        </p>
       <p>An effort to understand the specificities and complexities of <span class="tag place">Russia</span>, its <span class="tag event">revolution</span> and <span class="tag event">civil war</span>, and the colossal transformation of a 
        peasant society into an urban and industrial Great Power requires investments of time, energy, and curiosity, combined with much humility 
        about what we know and can be expected to find out. But then that is what the writing of history is all about.
        </p>
        <h3>The Man Who Would Be Stalin</span></h3>
        <p>More than three decades ago, I turned from deep investigations of Georgian history to a serious study of <span class="tag place">Georgia’s</span> most famous and notorious son, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Ioseb Jughashvili</span>, the man who became <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>. There were already dozens of biographies of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, and the need for another was disputable. But my interest was in his early life, his trajectory from the provincial town of <span class="tag place">Gori</span> where he was born to the <span class="tag event">October Revolution</span>.</p>
        <p>This was the least explored part of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> life, even though he had lived as long before the revolution as he did after. When asked by a popular biographer who was plowing the same ground what I was focusing on, I answered that my interest was in the revolutionary movement, Social Democracy, labor, and Marxist thought and politics. “Oh good,” he said with relief, “I am interested in his women.”</p>
        <p>I set out to place <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> within the competing cultures through which the son of an alcoholic shoemaker became a major revolutionary and the architect of what he proclaimed to be the first “socialist” society in history. Toward the end of his life, he was arguably the most powerful individual in the world. Yet at various earlier times, he had been seen as a “gray blur,” “the man who missed the revolution,” a “mediocrity” hooked by history. He was <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin’s</span> “marvelous Georgian,” in wartime the “Generalissimo,” and still later “History’s villain.”</p>
        <p>Eschewing the methods of psychohistory, I nevertheless needed to probe into a man, his mind, and experience, all of which were singularly opaque. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> is without doubt one of the most tempting and, at the same time, least hospitable subjects for a biographer. Not particularly introspective, he left few intimate letters, no secret diary, and many dubious witnesses to his inner life.</p>
        <p>Moreover, <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks">Bolshevik</span> political culture was hostile to open personal expression and imposed on <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and its other adherents an enforced modesty. Denial of the importance of self was part of the Social Democratic tradition. Even as a grotesque cult of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> personality grew to gargantuan proportions, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> would continue, disingenuously, to claim that he disliked all the fuss.</p>
        <p>At different times in his life, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> created distinct mystifying narratives about who he was. In the <span class="tag date">1930s</span>, that narrative drew parallels with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Great">Peter the Great</span> and then with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible">Ivan the Terrible</span>. His earlier narratives were romances about <span class="tag place">Georgia</span>, the revolutionary hero, the practical man of the underground, the hardened, steeled Bolshevik, who in time became the <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</span> loyalist, the man of the moderate middle, and soon afterwards the radical transformer of <span class="tag place">Russia’s</span> reality.</p>
        <h3>Stalin Before Stalinism</h3>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> life story has always been more than biography. There is wonder at the achievement — the son of a Georgian cobbler ascending the heights of world power; the architect of an <span class="tag event">industrial revolution</span> and the destruction of millions of the people he ruled; the leader of the state that stopped the bloody expansion of fascism. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> story is that of the making of the <span class="tag place">Soviet Union</span> and a particular vision of what he called socialism. His biographers have often placed historical imagination at the service of a specific politics of eroding (or lauding) the Stalinist inheritance.</p>
        <p>Such a life story cannot be separated from an evaluation of that life’s work. In twenty-first-century <span class="tag place">Russia</span>, visions of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> are deployed to justify yet another slide into authoritarianism, while in the West, the entirety of the Soviet experience is often reduced to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and Stalinism, <span class="tag event">the Great Purges</span>, and the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">gulag</span>. The drama of his life, the achievements and tragedies, are so morally and emotionally charged that they challenge the usual practices of historical objectivity and scholarly neutrality. When it comes to <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, gossip is reported as fact; legend provides meaning.</p>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> early years — before he was <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> — are the most elusive and obscure period of his life. Here the lasting fascination with the demon dictator is matched by an irresistible temptation to make his childhood and youth “useful,” by investing them with the first signs of the paranoid revolutionary-from-above of the <span class="tag date">1930s</span>, the arch-criminal who presided over the death of millions.</p>
        <p>Those who “know” the autocratic <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> of totalitarian <span class="tag place">Russia</span> have read back the characteristics of the general secretary into the young <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, emphasizing what fits — violence, paranoia, arrogance, and the need to dominate — and rejecting what does not — romanticism, literary sensibility, love for his homeland, and revolutionary idealism. As important as <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> early life was to the formation of his personality, the difficulties of reconstructing it from the few extant memoirs about his youth and scanty available documentation have sometimes led to flimsily-built psychoanalytic speculation, and, at other times, to fanciful arguments that <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> must have been an agent for the tsar’s <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okhrana">Okhrana</span> (political police).</p>
        <h3>The Perils of Psychohistory</h3>
        <p>Reducing the complexity of the biographical subject to a single explanatory key — in <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> case, the psychohistorians have proposed parental abuse — impoverishes explanation. Most historians have been suspicious of a method that leaves so much out — culture and context, politics and ideas — and renders stated motivations suspect, reducing them to psychological functions (rationalization, compensation, sublimation).</p>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> boyhood friend, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioseb_Iremashvili">Ioseb Iremashvili</span>, later a political opponent, composed the first memoir of the Soviet ruler’s childhood, where he made the primary psychological deduction later followed by other biographers:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Undeserved, terrible beatings made the boy as hard and heartless as his father himself. Since all men who had authority over others
                 either through power or age reminded him of his father, there soon arose a feeling of revenge against all men who stood above him.
                  From his youth the realization of his thoughts of revenge became the goal toward which everything was aimed.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> evidently had a different evaluation of the disciplining practiced by his parents. When the popular German biographer <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Ludwig">Emil Ludwig</span>, known for his interviews with the political celebrities of the interwar years, met with <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> in the <span class="tag place">Kremlin</span>, he indelicately broached the issue of parental abuse: “What pushed you into opposition? Perhaps the bad treatment by your parents?” <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> did not take the bait, however. “No,” he answered. “My parents were uneducated people, but they treated me not badly at all.”</p>
        <h3>A Product of His Environments</h3>
        <p>Yet, as I dug into the sources, I realized that for all his dissembling and deception, his playacting and posturing, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> revealed himself through what he did and said in public. Ten years after I began my research, the Soviet archives were opened, and more reliable testimonies came forth. Biographers were able for the first time to place the man in his private world, show his limits as well as his talents, and work toward a portrait that might explain the seemingly inexplicable.</p>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> was an exceptional individual because of what he became and what he did, the positions he occupied in a tumultuous time. But like many people in higher politics, he was at the same time quite ordinary — a small man placed in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
        <p>In my book, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> psychological evolution is treated as the interplay between the developing character of the boy from Georgia, and the social and cultural environments through which <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso Jughashvili</span> — later <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Koba</span>, still later <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> — moved. Each of these environments — the ethnocultural setting of <span class="tag place">Georgia</span>, the revolutionary intelligentsia, the Marxist movement, the underground, prison and exile, on to the upper circles of Russian Social Democracy, the fire of <span class="tag event">civil war</span>, the inner workings of the Soviet political system, and the political cultures of socialism — left its imprint upon <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span>, changing him along the way.</p>
        <p>As life’s experiences molded him, what he was becoming modified what he had been. He was not born a criminal and did not become a Caucasian bandit. Rather than being a gangster out to enrich himself, he was the product of — and a participant in — an evolving culture of the underground revolutionary. Idealism and ideology, as well as resentment and ambition, impelled him to endure the risks and recklessness of a political outlaw.</p>
        <p>He hardened himself, accepted the necessity of deception, ruthlessness, and violence — all these means justified by the end of social and political liberation. Before the story of a “revolution betrayed” can be told, the story must first be recounted of how a political revolutionary was made, along with the emergence of the revolutionary movement, its possibilities, ambitions, and trials.</p>
        <h3>Georgian Complexities</h3>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> spent the first third of his life in <span class="tag place">Georgia</span>. He was born, raised, and educated in that beautiful and troubled land, and <span class="tag place">Georgia</span> was the first cultural environment that he experienced. Yet it is hard to claim that <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Jughashvili</span> became <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> because of something essentially Georgian, as there is no archetypical Georgian.</p>
        <p>His boyhood country was a lively arena in which people defined and defended what they considered to be their culture and its values, often bitterly disagreeing with other members of the same ethnicity. Nationalists like to think of ethnic culture as something harmonious and consistent, with those inside that culture sharing characteristics that differ radically from those outside. But <span class="tag place">Georgia</span> was part of a larger Caucasian cultural sphere and embedded in the imperial Russian polity with its own cultural and social influences.</p>
        <p>Among Georgians, values and behaviors were simultaneously shared and contested. Older traditions contended with novel divisions of power and shifts in status and gender hierarchies. Poets and politicians made claims about what was authentically “Georgian.” In the half century before <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> birth, there were those ready to “police” the boundaries of Georgian culture, tell others what was authentic and proper, and discipline deviants.</p>
        <p>Aspects of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> ethnic culture were breaking down and being reformulated, and intellectuals turned their attention to what they feared was about to be lost. But young <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso Jughashvili</span>, influenced by his doting mother, identified intensely with <span class="tag place">Georgia</span>, its practices and preferences, the beautiful intricacies and cadences of its language, its music, and its hypermasculine gender regime.</p>
        <h3>Koba the Marxist</h3>
        <p>A more mature <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Koba</span> eventually broke through what he found to be the confining limits of nationality to identify with an explicitly anti-nationalist political party and its socialist future. In rapid succession, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso</span> left the largely Georgian town of his birth and entered other cultural milieus: the <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasian_Teachers_Seminary">Orthodox Christian seminary</span>, the intelligentsia, the movement, and the party.</p>
        <p>By his twenty-first birthday, he had become a professional revolutionary defined by a new culture: the political culture of Russian Social Democracy, with its specific forms of moral and personal behavior, its idealized self-representations of what constituted an <em>intelligent</em> (a radical political intellectual), and its elaborate codes of loyalty and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>During <span class="tag event">the Cold War</span>, battalions of Soviet and Western scholars explored the history of Russian Social Democracy, the Marxist movement that had split irrevocably into <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks">Bolshevik</span> and <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensheviks">Menshevik</span> tendencies by <span class="tag date">1905</span>, and whose radical wing led by <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</span> came to power in <span class="tag date">October 1917</span>. The stories they told were diametrically opposed to one another, each a product of the intellectual and political imperatives of their respective worlds.</p>
        <p>With the fall of the <span class="tag place">Soviet Union</span>, interest in the intricacies of the political struggles of the Marxist factions, and their meanings and influences on the Soviet future evaporated. Yet at the same moment, the less contentious environment of the post-Soviet period, along with the opening of Soviet archives, made possible a reevaluation of the history of Russian (and Georgian) Marxism, and their respective and distinct labor movements.</p>
        <p>Since those movements and the Marxist underground were the major breeding grounds for <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and those around him, I have undertaken in <em>Stalin: Passage to Revolution</em> a fresh reading of the history of those movements out of which the Soviet experiment and <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> himself emerged.</p>
        <h3>The Logic of War</h3>
        <p>Elaborating the cultural worlds through which the young <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> passed makes possible a fuller understanding of the sources of the Soviet leader’s particular psychology, and the determinants of his personal and political trajectory. An understanding of the man comes from setting him in his time and place, even though some parts of his inner workings undoubtedly remain elusive, buried in regions to which historians are not admitted.</p>
        <p>Poverty was the condition of the world into which he came. The constant and demanding attention and fierce adulation focused on her son by <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso’s</span> single present parent, his mother, fed his social resentment at his place in the scheme of things. Aware of being marginalized and at the same time talented, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso</span> found that hard work and discipline moved him to the front of the class. His inheritance from both parents was ambition.</p>
        <p>The usual biographical narrative, with its organic continuity between boy, young adult, and mature man, is challenged by the reconstruction of the available fragments of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin’s</span> life. Those fragments suggest a much more disjointed evolution, in the course of which <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso/Koba/Stalin</span> shed one identity and took on another. The obedient child and priest-in-training became a rebel; the Georgian patriot and romantic poet became an assimilated Russian — though only in part, and primarily in his public posture. The militant Bolshevik at times took on the coloring of a moderate.</p>
        <p>As he moved physically and psychologically away from <span class="tag place">Georgia</span>, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> left behind a culture in which one’s sense of personhood derived from family, friends, and nation, and entered a world in which one defined one’s own nature in line with a particular understanding of historical direction and the unforgiving imperatives of politics. By becoming a rebel against the existing order, revolutionaries like <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> declared <span class="tag event">war</span> on constituted authorities.</p>
        <p>For Marxists in the <span class="tag place">Russian Empire</span>, politics were less about compromise and persuasion, and more about the violent, unforgiving confrontations to be found on the battlefield. A logic of war prevailed, one that required (sometimes with regret) the use of violence. <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> responded both to inner needs and external possibilities and challenges, and was deeply changed by the experiences of <span class="tag organization" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasian_Teachers_Seminary">seminary</span>, underground, prison, <span class="tag event">revolution</span>, <span class="tag event">civil war</span>, and political power. The figure that emerged on the world stage was simultaneously a product of the successive cultures through which he passed, and an actor making choices and defining himself in unprecedented and unpredictable historical circumstances.</p>
        <p>Delving deep into <span class="tag place">Georgia</span> and its culture, I attempted carefully to construct a mosaic of diverse pieces of information — from the variety of archival documents, official and unofficial memoirs, even photographs — until a legible portrait of young <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> emerged. My aim was to evoke from that mosaic a credible and convincing interpretation of the evolution of the boy, <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Soso Jughashvili</span>, through the young <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Koba</span>, to the mature <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> — an elucidation of his personal, psychological, and political formation that could shed light on his motivations and choices.</p>
        <p><span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Jughashvili</span> remains an elusive character, even to the most diligent scholar, but his early life provides important clues to the mysteries of <span class="tag person" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</span> and, hopefully, offers some understanding of why a <span class="tag event">revolution</span> committed to human emancipation ended up in dictatorship and terror.</p>
