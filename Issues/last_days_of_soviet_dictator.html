                    <p>On the other hand, the actions of<span data-type="person" data-id="GeMa">Malenkov</span>,<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="NiKh">Khrushchev</span>and<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>can be explained by fear. During the rule of<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>, no one was immune from unexpected
                        repressions, especially his closest circle. And the dictator himself liked to remind them about
                        this from time to time. So given his suspiciousness, the trio could have gotten into trouble
                        even if they had called the doctors right away. The leader could suspect that they want to
                        declare him incompetent and remove him from power.</p>
                    <p>In the<span data-type="date">2000s</span>, a new theory appeared that<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>was allegedly poisoned with warfarin. This drug thins the blood,
                        preventing it from clotting. But in case of an overdose, it can cause severe bleeding. However,
                        modern medical research refutes this theory, based on data on the autopsy of<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalinʼs</span>body. And it is unlikely that anyone would
                        be able to bring something suspicious to<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Stalinʼs</span>dacha. Even his closest four comrades were thoroughly searched
                        by the guards twice — at the gate and at the entrance to the house. And this especially annoyed
                        the old Chekist<span data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>.</p>
                    <p>This was the name given to the employees of the<span data-type="organization"

                        According to researchers, he had a strong motive to get rid of the leader. After all, it
                        was<span data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>who was to become the main figure in

                            data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>. They were accused of a "nationalist conspiracy" with the aim

                            data-type="date">November 1951</span>. And in<span data-type="date">April 1953</span>, a
                        high-profile public trial was to take place, at which the accused were supposed to name<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>as the main organizer.</p>
                    <p>— another repressive campaign that<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>launched
                        at the end of his life.</p>
                    <p>Historians cite some facts to support this theory. It was<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>who selected the doctors who tried to save<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>and allegedly told them what to write in the
                        medical documents. They recall the story of<span data-type="person" data-id="ArRu">Arseniy
                            Rusakov</span>, who was part of the group of doctors who
                        performed<span>Stalinʼs</span>autopsy. Apparently, he detected signs of poisoning of the leader.
                        But already on<span data-type="date">April 12, 1953</span>, he "died prematurely." The day
                        after<span data-type="event" data-id="StDe">Stalinʼs death</span>, by order of<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>, all the dictatorʼs bodyguards were laid off
                        and sent away from<span data-type="place" data-id="plMo">Moscow</span>. Later, two of them
                        committed suicide — according to the official version, they shot themselves. Also, by order
                        of<span data-type="person" data-id="LaBe">Beria</span>, not only all papers, but also furniture
                        and dishes were removed from the dacha.</p>
                    <p>Later, rumors appeared that<span data-type="person" data-id="VyMo">Vyacheslav
