                    <p> Dictator Joseph Stalin , who ruled the USSR for more than thirty years, died on March 5, 1953.
                        According to the official version, it was caused by a brain hemorrhage enhanced by hypertensive
                        crisis. But there are numerous conspiracy theories about the assassination of Stalin . This
                        year, the "Communists of Russia" party asked the FSB to investigate the involvement of "Western
                        special services" in the dictatorʼs death. There are indeed many white spots in the history of
                        Stalinʼs death. However, as the researchers testify, if there is anyone to suspect, it is the
                        immediate circle of the Kremlin leader. And especially his closest associate Lavrentiy Beria .
                        Babel tells about the state of Stalinʼs health, which was not as strong as it was presented by
                        propaganda, about the official version of the last days of his life and, of course, about
                        versions of a possible murder.</p>

                    <h2>Stalin had poor health and did not trust doctors</h2>
                    <p>The state of health of Kremlin leaders is still one of the most important state secrets. During
                        Stalinʼs time, this secret was guarded especially strictly, and propaganda spread the myth of a
                        "strong Caucasian body". So the researchers had to collect real facts piecemeal — in fragments
                        of documents, letters, and memories.</p>
                    <p>Stalinʼs first serious health problems began around 1926, when he was 48 years old. He complained
                        of severe pain in the muscles of his arms and legs. On the recommendation of doctors, Stalin
                        underwent a course of hydrogen sulfide baths in Abkhazia.</p>
                    <p>Georgian province, now an effectively Russia-occupied quasi-state.</p>
                    <p>He was periodically treated at these resorts throughoutthe 1930s.</p>
                    <figure><img src="../issues/img/art_1_2.webp">

                    <p>In the early 1940s, Stalin developed new problems — signs of hypertension and atherosclerosis. By
                        the end of the Second World War, the problems intensified. At the end of 1945, he had his first
                        heart attack, and in 1946, Stalin suffered a severe stroke. During these periods, even his
                        daughter Svetlana was forbidden not only to visit her father, but also to call him.</p>
                    <p>Despite this, Stalin did not lead a healthy lifestyle. He smoked a lot, regularly drank alcohol,
                        especially before going to bed. And he went to bed late after 15-18 hours of sedentary working
                        day. His "diet" consisted of fatty Caucasian dishes.</p>
                    <p>He followed the doctorsʼ advice selectively. After a stroke in 1946, he spent more time at his
                        suburban dacha in Kuntsevo.</p>
                    <p>Now Kuntsevo is part of one of the districts of Moscow, the dacha is under state guard.</p>
                    <p>There, Stalin walked a lot in the park in the fresh air, but continued to smoke and drink
                        alcohol. Also, he slept too little. When his health took a turn for the worse, he abruptly quit
                        smoking on the eve of his 72nd birthday in December 1952. Of course, it was not easy for the
                        smoker with more than 50 years of experience. He gained weight, became irritable and agitated,
                        and had problems with blood pressure.</p>

                    <p>In addition, telling the chief about his illnesses was dangerous for the health of the doctors
                        themselves. In 1927, rumors spread in Moscow medical circles about the sudden death of the
                        well-known neuropathologist and psychiatrist Vladimir Bekhterev . According to legend, he was
                        called to examine Stalin , and he unexpectedly diagnosed the Soviet dictator with a severe form
                        of paranoia, in addition to neurological problems. Bekhterev told his acquaintances about his
                        discovery. And in a few days, he died right during a congress of neuropathologists and
                        psychiatrists. According to the official version, the doctor "poisoned with canned goods" at the
                        banquet. No forensic investigation into the circumstances of death was conducted, and the body
                        was quickly cremated.</p>
                    <p>Vladimir Vinogradov was Stalinʼs personal physician from the mid-1940s. In 1952, he strongly
                        advised the dictator to work less and rest more. Stalin suspected a conspiracy, thinking that
                        his enemies allegedly tried to remove him from the leadership of the state in this way. In
                        November 1952, Vinogradov ended up in prison as part of the "Doctorsʼ Affair".</p>
                    <p>A criminal case was fabricated in 1952- 1953 against a group of famous Soviet doctors who were
                        accused of conspiring and murdering several Soviet leaders. Most of those arrested had Jewish
                        roots, so historians consider this case part of a large-scale anti-Semitic campaign in the USSR
                        that began in the late 1940s.</p>
                    <p>— one of the large-scale repressive campaigns personally overseen by Stalin at the end of his
                        life. Since then, no one has conducted medical examinations of the dictator. And the medical
                        history, which was kept by Vinogradov , was destroyed by Stalinʼs personal order.</p>

                    <h2>The last days of Stalin — the official version</h2>
                    <p>In recent months, Stalin hardly appeared in the Kremlin. He spent all his time at the country
                        house in Kuntsevo. Sometime before lunch, he slept, and then he got down to business. In the
                        evening, he usually summoned four people from his closest circle to him — the deputies in the
                        government, Georgy Malenkov , Lavrentiy Beria , and Nikolai Bulganin , and the first secretary
                        of the Moscow Regional Committee , Nikita Khrushchev . Together they discussed business, had
                        dinner, drank, and watched movies until late at night.</p>
                    <p>Such a party took place at Stalinʼs dacha on February 28, 1953. The guests left around five in
                        the morning. According to Khrushchevʼs recollections, Stalin saw them off personally, drank a
                        lot and was in a good humor: "He joked a lot, poked me in the stomach with his finger, calling
                        me Mykyta. He always used the Ukrainian form of my name when he was in a good mood."</p>

                    <p>On the first of March, Stalin did not leave his room at noon, as was usually the case. Motion
                        detectors installed in each room did not detect any movements. So the guards began to worry, but
                        they did not dare to look into the chiefʼs bedroom. Finally, around six in the evening, the
                        light came on in his room, so the security relaxed a bit. A reason to go to the chiefʼs room was
                        found only around ten in the evening — business mail was brought, and it had to be handed over
                        personally.</p>
                    <p>One of the guards entered the room and found Stalin in a helpless state on the floor. The
                        security moved him to the couch and called their direct supervisor, Minister of State Security
                        Semyon Ignatiev . According to the recollections of the guards, he did not dare to decide
                        something on his own, but sent his subordinates to Malenkov and Beria . They arrived around 1
                        AM, Khrushchev and Bulganin arrived later. After long hesitation, Malenkov and Beria decided to
                        look into Stalinʼs room. Malenkov even took off his shoes so that they would not squeak. In a
                        few minutes, they returned, said that Stalin was asleep, and scolded the guards for causing an
                        unreasonable panic. After that, all four left.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of March 2, the guards reported that something was wrong with the leader. Then the
                        "four" finally decided to call the doctors to the dacha. They quickly diagnosed Stalin with a
                        massive hemorrhage in the left hemisphere of the brain due to hypertension and atherosclerosis
                        of blood vessels. As a result — loss of speech, paralysis of the right arm and left leg. The
                        next day, an expanded council of doctors announced the verdict — Stalinʼs death was inevitable
                        within days, if not hours.</p>

                    <p>On March 4, the Pravda newspaper published an announcement about Comrade Stalinʼs "severe
                        illness." And around ten in the evening on March 5, doctors declared his death.</p>

                    <h2>Versions about the murder</h2>
                    <p>There are many conspiracy theories about Stalinʼs death, as if the dictator was killed. But none
                        of them can be confirmed due to the lack of documents and closed access to the archives of the
                        Kremlin special services.</p>
                    <p>Most historians and researchers agree that when it comes to Stalinʼs murder, the culprits should
                        be sought in his closest circle. First of all, this concerns Malenkov , Beria and Khrushchev .
                        Bulganin never had real power and strength. He was an old party member who from time to time
                        "plugged" holes in various ministries and departments.</p>
                    <p>Malenkov , Beria and Khrushchev can be accused of not providing timely assistance to Stalin .
                        With such a diagnosis, even in modern medicine, the patientʼs chances of survival are 50/50, and
                        this is under the conditions of operative medical care. And doctors were allowed to see Stalin
                        almost half a day later. However, it is unlikely that these three would be able to organize a
                        conspiracy, even a spontaneous one. Actually, Stalin was the person who kept them from starting
                        to fight among themselves for power.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, the actions of Malenkov , Khrushchev and Beria can be explained by fear.
                        During the rule of Stalin , no one was immune from unexpected repressions, especially his
                        closest circle. And the dictator himself liked to remind them about this from time to time. So
                        given his suspiciousness, the trio could have gotten into trouble even if they had called the
                        doctors right away. The leader could suspect that they want to declare him incompetent and
                        remove him from power.</p>
                    <p>In the 2000s, a new theory appeared that Stalin was allegedly poisoned with warfarin. This drug
                        thins the blood, preventing it from clotting. But in case of an overdose, it can cause severe
                        bleeding. However, modern medical research refutes this theory, based on data on the autopsy of
                        Stalinʼs body. And it is unlikely that anyone would be able to bring something suspicious to
                        Stalinʼs dacha. Even his closest four comrades were thoroughly searched by the guards twice — at
                        the gate and at the entrance to the house. And this especially annoyed the old Chekist Beria .

                    <p>This was the name given to the employees of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (in Russian
                        — Cheka) for the fight against counter-revolution and sabotage — the state security body of
                        Soviet Russia in 1917- 1922. Its successors were the United State Political Administration
                        (OGPU) , the Peopleʼs Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) , and then the State Security
                        Committee (KGB) . Beria headed the NKVD in 1938- 1945.</p>

                    <h2>The main suspect is Beria</h2>
                    <p>In the story of Stalinʼs death, Lavrentiy Beria deserves the most suspicion. According to
                        researchers, he had a strong motive to get rid of the leader. After all, it was Beria who was to
                        become the main figure in the "Megreli case".</p>
                    <p>The campaign against high-ranking officials and prosecutors of the Georgian SSR, who were from
                        Megrelia, a historical region in western Georgia. They were accused of a "nationalist
                        conspiracy" with the aim of separating Georgia from the USSR. The first arrests began in
                        November 1951. And in April 1953, a high-profile public trial was to take place, at which the
                        accused were supposed to name Beria as the main organizer.</p>
                    <p>— another repressive campaign that Stalin launched at the end of his life.</p>
                    <p>Historians cite some facts to support this theory. It was Beria who selected the doctors who
                        tried to save Stalin and allegedly told them what to write in the medical documents. They recall
                        the story of Arseniy Rusakov , who was part of the group of doctors who performed Stalinʼs
                        autopsy. Apparently, he detected signs of poisoning of the leader. But already on April 12,
                        1953, he "died prematurely." The day after Stalinʼs death, by order of Beria , all the
                        dictatorʼs bodyguards were laid off and sent away from Moscow. Later, two of them committed
                        suicide — according to the official version, they shot themselves. Also, by order of Beria, not
                        only all papers, but also furniture and dishes were removed from the dacha.</p>
                    <p>Later, rumors appeared that Vyacheslav Molotov , Stalinʼs long-term foreign minister, allegedly
                        told how during a parade on Red Square on May 1, 1953, Beria whispered in his ear: "It was I who
                        saved you all from Stalin ."</p>

                    <p>According to the memoirs of Beriaʼs son Sergo , his mother Nina said to her husband after the
                        leaderʼs death: "Your position is even more precarious now than during Stalinʼs life." Her words
                        turned out to be prophetic. At the end of June 1953, Malenkov and Khrushchev conspired and
                        arrested Beria . In December of the same year, he was shot. Beria was officially accused of
                        anything — treason, working for British intelligence , counter-revolutionary activities, but not
                        involvement in Stalinʼs death.</p>
