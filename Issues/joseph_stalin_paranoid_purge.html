                        his very emphasis on military professionalism that struck at the principle of party

                        to explain the arrests,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>charged: “These men

                        The<span data-type="organization" data-id="GeAr">German Army</span>wants the government here to
                        be overthrown and they undertook to accomplish that but didn’t succeed. The<span

                        before, saying: “I am greatly to blame. I did not detect these base traitors.” But he was quick
                        to spread the blame. “I cannot point to a single warning signal from you,” he said, adding, “I
                        never trusted<span data-type="person" data-id="MiTu">Tukhachevsky</span>.” He went on to warn
                        the generals: “We have not purged everyone yet. I personally don’t doubt that there are people
                        who thought they were only talking, that’s all. They chattered: ‘It would be a good thing to

                    <p>From his cell, Marshal<span data-type="person" data-id="IoYa">Yakir</span>wrote<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>a pitiful plea for mercy. “My entire

                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>political toadies followed suit. “Entire

                    <p>That outcome was foreordained when<span data-type="person"

                            data-type="person" data-id="VsBl">Vasilli Blyukher</span>, was beaten to death after
                        refusing to confess; his widow said he looked like a tank had run over him. In two years’ time,
                        36,671<span data-type="organization" data-id="RdAr">Red Army</span>officers were executed,
                        shipped to the<span data-type="organization" data-id="Gulg">gulag</span>, or dismissed from
                        service. Those who were killed were probably luckier than those who were imprisoned. One general
                        who survived internment recalled seeing other officers in his camp “on all fours, howling and
                        rooting about, they had become semi-idiots whom no amount of beating could drive from the refuse
                        heaps.”</p>
                    <p>The scale of the<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>was staggering: 13 of 15 army
                        commanders, 50 of 57 corps commanders, 154 of 186 divisional commanders, 220 of 406 brigade
                        commanders, all 11 vice-commanders of defense, 98 of 108 members of the Supreme Military
                        Soviets, all army political commissars, 25 of 28 corps commissars, 58 of 64 divisional
                        commissars. Even the lower ranks were not spared: almost half the colonels and 7,403 captains
                        fell victim to the<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>. “This is worse than when

                    <p>“With each arrest it became more difficult to believe in the disloyalty, the sabotage, the

                            Gorbatov</span>. When he protested the arrest of his superior, he was inevitably jailed
                        himself. Other officers he met in jail advised him to confess to anything about anyone “because
                        they believed it was better to stand on their false testimony in order to put an end as quickly
                        as possible to the torment and to die as quickly as possible.” But<span data-type="person"

                        After having eight teeth knocked out and three ribs broken, he was hauled before the<span

                        agreeing with the accusation and taking a bullet,<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>shouted back, “Can the dead give evidence?” “What do you
                        mean the dead?” the surprised judge asked.<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>replied, “Well,<span data-type="person"

                        records bore him out,<span data-type="person" data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>became perhaps
                        the only defendant ever acquitted in the<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>,

                    <h2>The Outcome of the Purge</h2>
                    <p>The effects of the<span data-type="event" data-id="StGP">purge</span>could be seen in the
                        disastrous<span data-type="event" data-id="WiWa">winter war with Finland</span>in<span
                            data-type="date">1939</span>-<span data-type="date">1940</span>. As described by future
                        Soviet premier<span data-type="person" data-id="NiKh">Nikita Khrushchev</span>: “<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>was furious with the military and with<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>—justifiably in my opinion.<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>jumped up in a rage and started to
                        berate<span data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>.<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>was also boiling mad. He leaped up, turned red, and
                        hurled<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>accusations back in his face: ‘You
                        have yourself to blame for all this! You’re the one who had our best generals killed!’<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>then picked up a platter of roast
                        suckling pig and hurled it against the table.” Although dismissed as commissar for defense,<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="KlVo">Voroshilov</span>amazingly was not shot for his actions.
                        He survived<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>to serve as the<span

                        to a seaside resort to recuperate and equipped with twin rows of metal teeth. Always one to
                        enjoy toying with his victims,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>faked
                        surprise upon seeing<span data-type="person" data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>. “I don’t seem to
                        have seen you around for some time,” said the dictator. “Where did you go?” “I was
                        arrested,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Comrade Stalin</span>,”<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>responded. “I was sitting in prison.”<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>laughed. “A fine time you chose to go to
                        prison!”</p>
                    <p><span data-type="person" data-id="KoRo">Rokossovsky</span>went on to be the greatest Soviet

                            data-id="IeUb">Uborevich</span>can be regarded as modern military leaders. Most of them were

                            data-type="person" data-id="SeBu">Budenny</span>. Those heroes of the<span data-type="event"

                            data-id="IvKo">Konev</span>might have thought differently had he known that when he was

                        but was talked out of it by<span data-type="person" data-id="GrZh">Zhukov</span>.</p>
