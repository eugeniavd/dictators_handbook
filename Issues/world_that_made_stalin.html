                    <h2>The Man Who Would Be Stalin</h2>
                    <p>More than three decades ago, I turned from deep investigations of Georgian history to a serious
                        study of<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia’s</span>most famous and notorious
                        son,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Ioseb Jughashvili</span>, the man who became<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>. There were already dozens of biographies
                        of<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>, and the need for another was
                        disputable. But my interest was in his early life, his trajectory from the provincial town
                        of<span data-type="place" data-id="plGo">Gori</span>where he was born to the<span
                            data-type="event" data-id="OctR">October Revolution</span>.</p>
                    <p>This was the least explored part of<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>life,
                        even though he had lived as long before the<span data-type="event"
                            data-id="InSU">revolution</span>as he did after. When asked by a popular biographer who was
                        plowing the same ground what I was focusing on, I answered that my interest was in the
                        revolutionary movement, Social Democracy, labor, and Marxist thought and politics. “Oh good,” he
                        said with relief, “I am interested in his women.”</p>
                    <p>I set out to place<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>within the competing
                        cultures through which the son of an alcoholic shoemaker became a major revolutionary and the
                        architect of what he proclaimed to be the first “socialist” society in history. Toward the end
                        of his life, he was arguably the most powerful individual in the world. Yet at various earlier
                        times, he had been seen as a “gray blur,” “the man who missed the revolution,” a “mediocrity”
                        hooked by history. He was<span data-type="person" data-id="VlLe">Lenin’s</span>“marvelous
                        Georgian,” in wartime the “Generalissimo,” and still later “History’s villain.”</p>
                    <p>Eschewing the methods of psychohistory, I nevertheless needed to probe into a man, his mind, and
                        experience, all of which were singularly opaque.<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>is without doubt one of the most tempting and, at the same time,
                        least hospitable subjects for a biographer. Not particularly introspective, he left few intimate
                        letters, no secret diary, and many dubious witnesses to his inner life.</p>

                    <p>Such a life story cannot be separated from an evaluation of that life’s work. In

                        into authoritarianism, while in the West, the entirety of the Soviet experience is often reduced

                        his life. Here the lasting fascination with the demon dictator is matched by an irresistible

                        playacting and posturing,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>revealed himself
                        through what he did and said in public. Ten years after I began my research, the Soviet archives
                        were opened, and more reliable testimonies came forth. Biographers were able for the first time
                        to place the man in his private world, show his limits as well as his talents, and work toward a
                        portrait that might explain the seemingly inexplicable.</p>
                    <p><span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>was an exceptional individual because of
                        what he became and what he did, the positions he occupied in a tumultuous time. But like many
                        people in higher politics, he was at the same time quite ordinary — a small man placed in
                        extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                    <p>In my book,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>psychological evolution is

                    </p>
                    <p>As life’s experiences molded him, what he was becoming modified what he had been. He was not born
                        a criminal and did not become a Caucasian bandit. Rather than being a gangster out to enrich
                        himself, he was the product of — and a participant in — an evolving culture of the underground
                        revolutionary. Idealism and ideology, as well as resentment and ambition, impelled him to endure
                        the risks and recklessness of a political outlaw.</p>
                    <p>He hardened himself, accepted the necessity of deception, ruthlessness, and violence — all these
                        means justified by the end of social and political liberation. Before the story of a “revolution
                        betrayed” can be told, the story must first be recounted of how a political revolutionary was
                        made, along with the emergence of the revolutionary movement, its possibilities, ambitions, and

                        with those inside that culture sharing characteristics that differ radically from those outside.
                        But<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>was part of a larger Caucasian cultural
                        sphere and embedded in the imperial Russian polity with its own cultural and social influences.
                    </p>
                    <p>Among Georgians, values and behaviors were simultaneously shared and contested. Older traditions
                        contended with novel divisions of power and shifts in status and gender hierarchies. Poets and

                    <p>Poverty was the condition of the world into which he came. The constant and demanding attention
                        and fierce adulation focused on her son by<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Soso’s</span>single present parent, his mother, fed his social resentment at
                        his place in the scheme of things. Aware of being marginalized and at the same time
                        talented,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso</span>found that hard work and discipline
                        moved him to the front of the class. His inheritance from both parents was ambition.</p>
                    <p>The usual biographical narrative, with its organic continuity between boy, young adult, and
                        mature man, is challenged by the reconstruction of the available fragments of<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin’s</span>life. Those fragments suggest a much more
                        disjointed evolution, in the course of which<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Soso/Koba/Stalin</span>shed one identity and took on another. The obedient
                        child and priest-in-training became a rebel; the Georgian patriot and romantic poet became an
                        assimilated Russian — though only in part, and primarily in his public posture. The
                        militant<span data-type="organization" data-id="Blsh">Bolshevik</span>at times took on the
                        coloring of a moderate.</p>
                    <p>As he moved physically and psychologically away from<span data-type="place"
                            data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>,<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>left
                        behind a culture in which one’s sense of personhood derived from family, friends, and nation,
                        and entered a world in which one defined one’s own nature in line with a particular
                        understanding of historical direction and the unforgiving imperatives of politics. By becoming a
                        rebel against the existing order, revolutionaries like<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>declared<span data-type="event" data-id="CldW">war</span>on
                        constituted authorities.</p>
                    <p>For Marxists in the<span data-type="place" data-id="plRu">Russian Empire</span>, politics were
                        less about compromise and persuasion, and more about the violent, unforgiving confrontations to
                        be found on the battlefield. A logic of war prevailed, one that required (sometimes with regret)
                        the use of violence.<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>responded both to inner
                        needs and external possibilities and challenges, and was deeply changed by the experiences
                        of<span data-type="organization" data-id="OrCs">seminary</span>, underground, prison,<span
                            data-type="event" data-id="InSU">revolution</span>,<span data-type="event"
                            data-id="RuCW">civil war</span>, and political power. The figure that emerged on the world
                        stage was simultaneously a product of the successive cultures through which he passed, and an
                        actor making choices and defining himself in unprecedented and unpredictable historical
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Delving deep into<span data-type="place" data-id="plGe">Georgia</span>and its culture, I
                        attempted carefully to construct a mosaic of diverse pieces of information — from the variety of
                        archival documents, official and unofficial memoirs, even photographs — until a legible portrait
                        of young<span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>emerged. My aim was to evoke from
                        that mosaic a credible and convincing interpretation of the evolution of the boy,<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Soso Jughashvili</span>, through the young<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Koba</span>, to the mature<span data-type="person"
                            data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>— an elucidation of his personal, psychological, and political
                        formation that could shed light on his motivations and choices.</p>
                    <p><span data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Jughashvili</span>remains an elusive character, even to
                        the most diligent scholar, but his early life provides important clues to the mysteries of<span
                            data-type="person" data-id="JoSt">Stalin</span>and, hopefully, offers some understanding of
                        why a<span data-type="event" data-id="InSU">revolution</span>committed to human emancipation
                        ended up in dictatorship and terror.</p>
